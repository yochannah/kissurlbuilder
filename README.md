# URL Builder

A url builder for creating and storing utm campaign urls.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.1.5 (use [RVM](http://rvm.io/rvm/install) for simplicity)
* Node 0.10.33 (Other versions will work, but this was tested.
Feel free to use homebrew installation)

## Installation

   `cp .ruby-gemset.sample .ruby-gemset`

   `cp .ruby-version.sample .ruby-version`

   `cd .`

2. Install bundler and dependent gems

   `gem install bundler`

   `bundle install`

## Development
