<h1>Url Builder - Track Your Marketing Campaigns and Links</h1>

<p>
  By adding some extra data to your external links, youâ€™ll know when people come
  from those links. Most analytics tools (like KISSmetrics and Google Analytics)
  track those links automatically and will tell you how many customers you get
  from each campaign. Fill out the form to get your link built.
