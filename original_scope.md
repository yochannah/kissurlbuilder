### URL Builder - Track Your Marketing Campaigns and Links

By adding some extra data to your external links, you’ll know when people come
from those links. Most analytics tools (like KISSmetrics and Google Analytics)
track those links automatically and will tell you how many customers you get
from each campaign. Fill out the form to get your link built.

###### Required
---

What URL do you want to send people to?
* [URL Field]

##### *Campaign Medium*

This is the channel the link is being used in. Use broad categories like email,
social, or PPC.
* [Campaign Medium Field]

##### *Campaign Source*

What’s the specific place that you’ll be using this link? For example, “email”
is too broad for this one, use the name of your email list like “Newsletter” or
“Customer List”.
* [Campaign Source Field]

##### *Campaign Name*

Use any name you want. It should be the name of your entire marketing campaign.
This way, you can look at all the links from this campaign even if you use them
in different places and channels.
* [Campaign Name Field]

###### Optional
---

You don’t need to add this extra info unless you want to.

##### *Campaign Content*

If you use a bunch of links all in the same spot and all the fields above are
identical, you can use this field to add more detail. For example, one link
might be “header” while your second link is “footer.”
* [Campaign Content Field]

##### *Campaign Term*

If you’re using this link for search ads and also want to track the search term
you’re running your ad on, add a campaign term.
[Campaign Term Field]

* [CTA Button: Build my link!]
